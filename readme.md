This project is inspired by keegars' MHW - Reshade Injector Helper  
https://github.com/keegars/MHW---Reshade-Injector-Helper/tree/0.1

<pre>
The main difference between this and keegars' tool are listed below:  
	1. Uses official binary from reshade.me, automatically detect installed reshade update (manually installed from reshade_setup_x.x.x.exe).
	2. Shorten the delay between starting the injector and MHW.
	3. Missing file/wrong directory message.

To setup, go to reshade's website (https://reshade.me) and download reshade, then select MHW and DX12.
After installed the presets and shader packs, copy the content of this tool into MHW's root folder.
there are 3 files in total:  
	MHW-ReShadeInjector++.exe  
	inject.exe  
	uninstall_MHW-ReShadeInjector.bat  
Run 'MHW-ReShadeInjector++.exe' to start MHW with ReShade.  
When ReShade is first installed or updated, running this tool will auto update the file before start the injector.

To uninstall, just run uninstall_MHW-ReShadeInjector.bat to remove this tool.
